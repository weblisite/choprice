## 5. User Stories

- **As a Customer**, I want to browse the Choprice menu and order a Pilau for 390 KSh with free delivery on my phone's PWA, so I can enjoy a quick lunch at my office in Kilimani.
- **As a Kitchen Staff**, I want to see new orders in real-time on the admin PWA and mark them as prepared, so I can manage cooking for 25 plates/day efficiently.
- **As a Rider**, I want a PWA with a map to navigate from Kawangware to Westlands, so I can deliver orders within 45 minutes.
- **As an Admin**, I want to add a new dish like Cashewnut Rice via the admin PWA, so I can update the menu based on customer feedback.

- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 compliant for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **PWA Standards:** Offline capability, push notifications, installable on homescreen.

## 7. Constraints

- **Budget:** Initial tech cost ~KSh 50,000-100,000 (domain, Render paid plan if needed, APIs), plus development (KSh 200,000-500,000 if outsourcing).
- **Timeline:** MVP in 8-12 weeks, full launch by November 2025.
- **Team:** 1-2 developers (or freelance via Upwork), 1 designer (optional).

- **Profit:** Achieve 4,750 KSh/day minimum profit, targeting 9,500 KSh/day at 50 plates.

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

**Risk: Low initial orders.**
- Mitigation: Launch with WhatsApp orders, offer 350 KSh/plate promo for first week.

**Risk: Delivery delays.**
- Mitigation: Use electric bikes, optimize routes with Google Maps.

**Risk: Payment issues with M-Pesa.**
- Mitigation: Test Daraja API in sandbox, provide support contact.

**Risk: Competition from Uber Eats/Glovo.**
- Mitigation: Emphasize unique rice menu and free delivery in marketing.

## 10. Next Steps

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):**
- Setup backend (Node.js, Express) on Render.
- Configure Neon database (schema for users, orders, menu).
- Integrate Clerk for authentication.

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):**
- Develop website/PWA (React.js with Service Workers).
- Build admin and rider PWAs, integrate Google Maps.
- Test APIs and payment flow.

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):**
- Implement real-time updates (WebSocket or Firebase).
- Conduct user testing on PWAs.
- Deploy to Render.

**Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16):**
- Launch marketing campaign, soft launch in Kilimani.

## 11. Appendices

**Menu List:** Pilau, Biryani Rice, Coconut Rice, Cashewnut Rice, Rice Peas, Chinese Rice, Egg Fry Rice, Risotto, Rice and Chicken, Rice and Fish, Rice and Beef.

**Wireframes:** [To be designed â€“ suggest Figma for mockups].

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /menu`: Retrieve menu items.
- `POST /order`: Submit order with payment.
- `POST /pay`: Trigger M-Pesa STK Push.

**Tech Notes:**
- **Render:** Use free tier for MVP, upgrade to paid ($7/month) for higher traffic.
- **Neon:** Serverless PostgreSQL, free tier (0.5 GB) sufficient for MVP.
- **Clerk:** Free tier supports 10,000 MAUs, ideal for initial launch.
- **PWA:** Add manifest.json and Service Worker for offline support.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Backend Setup (Node.js + Express):

Install: `npm init -y && npm install express neon-postgres clerk-sdk-node cors`

Sample code (server.js):
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { Neon } = require('neon-postgres');
const { Clerk } = require('@clerk/clerk-sdk-node');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

const db = new Neon({ connectionString: 'YOUR_NEON_URL' });
const clerk = new Clerk({ secretKey: 'YOUR_CLERK_KEY' });

// Menu Table (example schema)
db.query('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS menu (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, price INT)');
app.get('/menu', async (req, res) => {
  const { rows } = await db.query('SELECT * FROM menu');
  res.json(rows);
});

// M-Pesa Integration (basic STK Push)
app.post('/pay', async (req, res) => {
  const { phone, amount } = req.body;
  // Placeholder for Daraja API call (implement with mpesa-node)
  res.send({ status: 'Payment initiated', phone, amount });
});

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, () => console.log('Server on Render'));
```

Deploy to Render with render.yaml for auto-scaling.

### Frontend/PWA (React.js):

Setup: `npx create-react-app choprice --template pwa`
Install: `npm install axios @clerk/react`

Sample Menu component (Menu.js):
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-react';
import axios from 'axios';

function Menu() {
  const { userId } = useAuth();
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('/menu').then(res => setItems(res.data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Choprice Menu</h1>
      <ul>
        {items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name} - 390 KSh</li>)}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={() => axios.post('/pay', { phone: userId, amount: 390 })}>Pay with M-Pesa</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Menu;
```

Add manifest.json for PWA installability.

**Rider/Admin PWAs:** Reuse React code, customize with dashboards.
